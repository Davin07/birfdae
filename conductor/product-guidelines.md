# Product Guidelines - Birthday Reminder App

## Brand Voice & Tone
*   **Warm & Celebratory:** A blend of helpful friendliness and celebratory enthusiasm. The app should feel like a supportive companion that is genuinely excited about the milestones it tracks.
*   **Encouraging & Clear:** Instructions should be easy to follow, using warm language while maintaining clarity to ensure the user feels confident and supported.

## Visual Identity
*   **Modern "Glass-Material" Fusion:** A sophisticated blend of Material Design 3 (Material You) and Glassmorphism.
    *   **Material Foundation:** Use MD3 for layout, dynamic theming, and hierarchy.
    *   **Glassmorphic Accents:** Employ frosted-glass effects (translucency and blur) for cards and overlays to add depth and a modern aesthetic.
    *   **Bold Minimalism:** Combine high-contrast, celebratory colors with clean whitespace and elegant typography for a look that is both striking and uncluttered.

## Design Principles
*   **Effortless Utility:** Prioritize "Effortless Entry" where adding a birthday is a friction-free experience, ideally requiring fewer than 3 taps.
*   **Glanceable Insights:** Key information like "days remaining" and "upcoming age" must be instantly readable at a glance from the home screen or widgets.
*   **Delightful Micro-interactions:** Infuse the experience with subtle, high-quality animations—such as gentle bounces or celebratory confetti—to reward interactions and celebrate milestones.

## Interaction Patterns
*   **Direct & Intuitive:** Navigation should follow standard Android patterns but feel enhanced by the modern visual style.
*   **Responsive Feedback:** Every action should provide clear, tactile, or visual feedback that reinforces the app's helpful and celebratory tone.
